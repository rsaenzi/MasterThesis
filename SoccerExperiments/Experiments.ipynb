        "### Abstract:\n",
        "Curriculum learning is a technique that can increase the learning speed of an intelligent agent that is learning a behavior policy to play a video game in an optimal way using reinforcement learning. It can be seen as a special form of transfer learning and is based on the idea of training using easier examples first, then using the harder complex ones later, to guide the optimization process. This technique is tested in a 3D 1-vs-1 soccer video game running in Unity, where two identical agents are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization, the training process for the second agent uses a 5-step curriculum designed to speed-up the learning rate.\n",

            "11.2 ARBITRATION.  Except as set forth below in Section 9.3, any dispute arising out of or in connection with the Agreement, including any disputes regarding the existence, validity or termination thereof, shall be settled by arbitration. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes by simplified arbitration arranged by The Danish Institute of Arbitration in accordance with the rules of simplified arbitration procedure adopted by The Danish Institute of Arbitration and in force at the time when such proceedings are commenced. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND UNITY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.\n",

If you reside (or your principal place of business is) within the United States and the parties have an intellectual property rights dispute, you and Unity agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. If you reside (or your principal place of business is) outside of the United States and the parties have an intellectual property rights dispute, you and Unity agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the courts located in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The English language version of the Agreement is legally binding in case of any inconsistencies between the English version and any translations. Any terms or conditions contained in your purchase order or other ordering document that are inconsistent with or in addition to the terms and conditions of the Agreement are hereby rejected by Unity and will be deemed null. You may not assign or transfer the Agreement or any rights granted hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without Unity’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to do so, without such consent, will be void. Unity may assign or transfer the Agreement, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.   Except as expressly set forth in the Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under the Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under the Agreement or otherwise. Unity will deliver all notices, approvals or other communications required or permitted under the Agreement, including those regarding modifications to the Agreement: (a) via e-mail (in each case to the address that you provide); or (ii) by posting to the Site, the Service Panel or your Unity Account.  For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. The failure by either party to enforce any provision of the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any waiver, modification or amendment of any provision of the Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties. If any provision of the Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the other provisions will remain in full force and effect.\n",

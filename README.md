# Evaluating the impact of curriculum learning on the training process for an intelligent agent in a videogame
## Maestría en Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Modalidad Profundización. Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Sede Bogotá

### Abstract:
Curriculum learning is a technique that can increase the learning speed of an intelligent agent that is learning a behaviour policy to play a video game in an optimal way using reinforcement learning. It can be seen as a special form of transfer learning and is based on the idea of training using easier examples first, then using the harder complex ones later, to guide the optimization process. This technique is tested in a 3D 1-vs-1 soccer video game running in Unity, where two identical agents are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization, the training process for the second agent uses a 5-step curriculum designed to speed-up the learning rate.

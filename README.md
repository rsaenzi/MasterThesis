# Evaluating the impact of Curriculum Learning on the training process for an intelligent agent in a videogame
## Maestría en Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Modalidad Profundización. Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Sede Bogotá

Abstract: Nowadays there are several open challenges for machine learning techniques when are applied to videogame specific problems. One interesting approach for dealing with some of these challenges is a technique called Curriculum Learning, which is based on the idea that learning using easier training examples at the beginning can improve the learning rate, giving best results in less time. Here we describe the process, advantages and challenges of implementing Curriculum Learning on a training process that uses Reinforcement Learning to teach an agent how to play an aerial warfare videogame made in Unity.

Keywords: curriculum learning, continuation method, machine learning, reinforcement learning, aerial warfare, air combat, sparse rewards, playtesting, videogames, game mechanic, game engine, unity, unity machine learning agents, ml-agents

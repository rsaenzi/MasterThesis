# Evaluating the impact of Curriculum Learning on the training process for an intelligent agent in a videogame
## Maestría en Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Modalidad Profundización. Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Sede Bogotá

Abstract: Curriculum learning is an interesting technique that can increase the learning speed of an intelligent agent that is learning how to play a video game via reinforcement learning, which is based on the idea of training on easier examples first, then on the harder complex ones later. This approach is used in a 3D Toy Soccer video game running in Unity, two identical agents are trained to play the game in an optimal way using Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm included in the Unity ML-Agent library, however the training process for the second agent includes a curriculum designed to speed-up the learning rate. Effectively the second agent learns an optimal behaviour policy faster than the first one. A quick survey of techniques, simulation platforms, applications and open challenges for Game AI is included.

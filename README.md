Abstract: Nowadays there are several open challenges for machine learning techniques when are applied to videogame specific problems. One interesting approach for dealing with some of these challenges is a technique called Curriculum Learning, which is based on the idea that learning using easier training examples at the beginning can improve the learning rate, giving best results in less time.
